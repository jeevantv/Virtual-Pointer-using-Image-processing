# Virtual-Pointer-using-Image-processing

This was our 6th sem project

# Project Description
 This program controls the functions of mouse pointer by detecting red, green and blue colored caps.
 
 # Inputs
 
redThresh = Threshold for red color detection.

greenThresh = Threshold for green color detection.


blueThresh = Threshold for blue color detection.

numFrame = Total number of frames duration.

numFrame = Total number of frames duration.

# controls
Use 1(One) RED, 1(One) GREEN and 3(Three) BLUE Caps for different fingers.

MOVE the RED finger everywhere to control the POINTER POSITION,

Show ONE BLUE finger to LEFT CLICK,

Show TWO BLUE finger to RIGHT CLICK,

Show THREE BLUE finger to DOUBLE CLICK,

MOVE the GREEN finger up and down to control the MOUSE SCROLL.

# Requirement
- Matlab software
- Computer Vision Toolbox
- Image Acquisition Toolbox
